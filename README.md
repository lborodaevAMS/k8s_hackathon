# k8s_hackathon

You are encouraged to use a Linux VM for this hackathon. Use your favourite package manager to install `docker`.  If you don't have `kubernetes` installed on your VM, you are advised to you `minikube`, which is a single-node k8s cluster. 

Navigate to challenge_0 to start. Happy hacking!
